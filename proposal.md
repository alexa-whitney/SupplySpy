# SupplySpy: Streamlined Inventory Management

## Problem Statement
In many organizations, managing inventory of office supplies and tech gadgets is often handled manually or with outdated systems. This leads to inefficiencies such as overstocking, stockouts, and time-consuming inventory audits. There is a need for a simple, yet effective, inventory management system that can streamline these processes and ensure that inventory levels are accurately maintained and easily accessible.

## Proposed Solution
**SupplySpy** is a web-based inventory management system designed to simplify tracking and managing inventory items such as office supplies and tech gadgets. By leveraging the Go programming language and the Gin web framework, SupplySpy will offer a responsive, easy-to-use interface for all inventory-related tasks.

## Key Features
- **Web Interface**: Utilize the `gin-gonic/gin` framework to create a user-friendly web interface that allows users to add, remove, and update inventory items.
- **Persistence**: Store inventory data in a SQLite database or a JSON file, providing a reliable way to maintain data across sessions.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Implement dynamic web pages that update inventory information without requiring page reloads.
- **Security**: Basic authentication to ensure that only authorized personnel can access the inventory data.

## Benefits
- **Efficiency**: Reduce the time spent on managing inventory by automating the process and allowing for quick updates and reports.
- **Accuracy**: Improve the accuracy of inventory records with real-time updates and a centralized database that reduces human error.
- **Cost-Effective**: Minimize the cost related to overstocking and understocking by maintaining optimal inventory levels.

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Write comprehensive unit tests for all functions, particularly focusing on database interactions and the accuracy of inventory updates.
- **Table-driven Tests**: Implement table-driven tests for the API endpoints to ensure they handle a variety of inputs correctly.
- **Benchmark Tests**: Conduct benchmark tests for database operations to ensure that the system can handle a significant load efficiently.

## Conclusion
With **SupplySpy**, the process of inventory management will become more streamlined, less prone to error, and accessible from anywhere within the organization. This tool is expected to significantly enhance productivity and reduce costs associated with inventory mismanagement.
